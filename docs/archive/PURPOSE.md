# UniPlaySong - Purpose and Goals

## Core Purpose

UniPlaySong provides a **console-like game preview experience** in Playnite. When you hover over or select a game in your library, music plays automatically - just like modern game consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch) preview games with their soundtracks.

## What It Does

1. **Plays Music on Game Selection/Hover**: When you hover over or select a game, its music automatically plays
2. **Downloads Game Music**: Provides tools to download game soundtracks and themes
3. **Manages Preview Music**: Lets you choose which songs play for each game
4. **Works Universally**: Functions in both desktop and fullscreen modes with any theme

## What It Does NOT Do

- ❌ General music library management
- ❌ Organizing music files across your system
- ❌ Sound effects for UI interactions (clicks, etc.)
- ❌ Complex music organization features

## User Experience Goal

**Console-like browsing**: Browse your game library and get an immediate audio preview of each game through its music, creating an immersive browsing experience similar to modern game consoles.

## Key Features (Planned)

1. **Automatic Music Playback**

   - Smooth transitions between tracks

2. **Simple Music Download**
   - Download game soundtracks from YouTube, KHInsider, etc.
   - One-click download for game music
   - Automatic organization by game

3. **Primary Song Selection**
   - Choose which song plays when previewing a game
   - Support for multiple songs with randomization

4. **Universal Compatibility**
