Reverb Algorithm:
The reverb effect implementation is based on the public domain Freeverb algorithm
by Jezar at Dreampoint (https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Freeverb.html).
The algorithm constants and structure follow the libSoX implementation.

Reverb Presets:
The reverb preset values (Acoustic, Ambience, Vocal I, etc.) are derived from
Audacity's factory presets for compatibility purposes. No actual Audacity code
or GPL-licensed software is included or redistributed - only parameter values
and presets are used to shape reverb algorithms. Audacity is licensed under
GPL v2/v3 (https://www.audacityteam.org/).
