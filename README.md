A Playnite extension that provides a console-like game music preview experience with controller-friendly song management. Music plays when browsing your game library, creating an immersive experience similar to PlayStation and Xbox game selection screens.

Designed for both Desktop and Fullscreen mode, with compatibility to modern themes (like ANIKI REMAKE).

Built with the help of Claude Code and Cursor IDE

## What's New - v1.3.3

- [Critical Fix] **Audio Artifact Eliminated** — Resolved a longstanding audio flutter/tremolo that occurred when Live Effects or Visualizer was enabled. The artifact had been present since Live Effects were introduced in v1.1.4 and was most noticeable during game switching and pause/resume.
- [Live Effects] **Smoother Fading** — Volume fades are now buttery smooth with no audible stepping. Pause/resume transitions should sound clean even with heavy reverb effects applied.
- [Experimental] **Configurable Fade Curves** — Five fade curve styles (Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, S-Curve, Logarithmic) independently selectable for fade-in and fade-out.
- [Performance] **Game Switch UI Lag Eliminated** — Eliminated an annoying ~70ms UI delay that occurred on every game switch when Live Effects or Visualizer was enabled (where faders masked this issue and it was apparent on lower-end hardware). Optimizations with NAudio should hopefully reduce unnecessary overhead with Playnite's UI.
- [Bugfix] **Short Track Reliability** — Short audio clips no longer get stuck or freeze playback controls when used with Live Effects.
- [Bugfix] **Pause/Resume Stability** — Fixed several edge cases where music could fail to resume after pausing, especially during game switches or with short tracks.
- [Improved] **Fade-In/Out Duration Slider** — Refined range (0.10–5s), finer 0.05s tick granularity for precise control, and a note about how Live Effects influence fade perception.

### Previous Version
- **v1.3.2**: Taskbar Thumbnail Media Controls, Global Media Key Control, Auto-Cleanup Empty Folders, M3U Playlist Export, Extended Default Music Sources, PS2 Menu Ambience, Per-Tab Reset Buttons, Improved Default Settings, Settings Reorganization
