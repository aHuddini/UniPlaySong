A Playnite extension that provides a console-like game music preview experience with controller-friendly song management. Music plays when browsing your game library, creating an immersive experience similar to PlayStation and Xbox game selection screens.

Designed for both Desktop and Fullscreen mode, with compatibility to modern themes (like ANIKI REMAKE).

Built with the help of Claude Code and Cursor IDE

## What's New - v1.2.11

### Performance Optimizations
**Hot Path Optimizations** - Multiple optimizations to reduce overhead during game selection:
- **Native Music Path Caching** - Eliminates 9 repeated method calls per game selection (for "Use Native Music as Default" users)
- **Static Random Instance** - Prevents allocations and fixes duplicate random sequences in shuffle mode
- **Song List Caching** - Directory scans cached in-memory, eliminating repeated file I/O when scrolling between games
  - **Performance gain**: ~2-8ms (SSD) or ~15-80ms (HDD) per cached re-selection
  - **Smart invalidation**: 17 call sites covering all file operations (downloads, trim, normalize, amplify, repair, deletes)
  - **Session-scoped**: Cache resets when Playnite restarts
  - **Opt-in toggle**: General Settings → Performance (disabled by default — enable if you notice lag when switching games)

**UI Thread Optimizations** - Converted blocking delays to async operations:
- Rate limiting delays during batch downloads
- File release delays before audio processing
- Eliminates UI freezes during file operations

### Previous Versions
- **v1.2.10**: Fullscreen performance fix (desktop visualizer init gate) + suppress call reduction
- **v1.2.9**: Stop After Song Ends + fullscreen performance fix (suppression timer removed)
- **v1.2.8**: Native music conflict fix — suppress toggle decoupled from Default Music settings
- **v1.2.7**: Critical fix — Spectrum visualizer working without Live Effects ([#66](https://github.com/aHuddini/UniPlaySong/issues/66))
